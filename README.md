# RNAseq analysis using R and Python

Welcome to our RNA Sequencing Analysis project! In this repository, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide for performing RNA sequencing analysis using both Python and R. This project is designed for researchers and practitioners who want to leverage the power of these two programming languages for their RNA-seq data analysis.

**Overview**

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique that allows researchers to study the transcriptome, providing insights into gene expression and regulation. In this project, we will cover the following key components:

**Introduction to RNA Sequencing**: We will begin with an overview of RNA-seq and discussing its importance.

**RNAseq Analysis using R(Rsubread)**: We will delve into the R programming environment, focusing on the use of the Rsubread package for RNA-seq data analysis. Rsubread is a widely used package for aligning RNA-seq reads and quantifying gene expression, and we will provide detailed explanations and code examples to guide you through the analysis process.

**RNASeq Analysis using Python(pyrpipe)**: Following our R analysis, we will transition to Python, utilizing the Pyripe library for RNA-seq data analysis. Pyripe is designed for efficient RNA-seq data processing and offers a variety of features to facilitate your analysis. We will provide step-by-step instructions and code snippets to help you implement your RNA-seq workflow in Python.
